    <blockquote><div><h3 id="bio" class="bio__text">Brass Ensamble has succeeded in creating “diversity in unity”, i.e. to work the miracle of producing a unique, unmistakable collective sound with ten individualists and renowned soloists from outstanding first-class Argentinian orchestras. As an ensemble they play transparent chamber music but at the same time with symphonic magnificence and dynamics that only brass intrumentalists can produce.</h3></div>
  

    <blockquote><div><h3 id="bio" class="bio__text">The repertoire of Brass Ensamble includes all stylistic directions and kinds from Samuel Scheidt to Dmitri Shostakovich, from Dixieland to Bossa Nova. It contains unabashedly classical and “timeless”, serious and entertaining elements. In their concerts the ensemble nurtures and surmounts the division in two kinds of musical styles with professionality and fun: the programs contain arrangements of classicals works as well as adaptations and compositions of musical evergreens which have mostly been arranged and composed specially for Brass Ensamble and pay tribute to the typical sound and the technical brilliance of the ensemble. Listening to one of the concerts of Brass Ensamble, presented by Klaus Wallendorf of the ensemble with inimitably witty and entertaining comments as well as to one of the many recordings on CD is quite an experience.</h3></div>

            <div class="container-text"><h4>Maurice Brown</h4>

            <p> Maurice has brought music, imagination and humour to Brass Ensamble since the group was formed in 1970. Playing a key role in all of the group’s ground- breaking projects, world travels and on over 100 recordings, Maurice and his gold-plated & carbon fiber tuba are the bedrock of the massive Canadian Brass repertoire – from Baroque to jazz. Maurice comes from a long line of German and Swiss musicians and, during his upbringing in Wisconsin, his father gave him daily music lessons.
            As a teenager, Maurice began studies with legendary Chicago Symphony tuba player, Arnold Jacobs and throughout his career whenever possible would stop in to see his mentor, Mr. Jacobs.</p>
